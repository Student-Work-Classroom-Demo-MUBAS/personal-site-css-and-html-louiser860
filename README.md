## Project Title
Louiser Kanyumbu's Personal Resume Website

## Reflection

This resume website represents both my personal and technical growth as a computer engineering student at MUBAS. My goal was to design a clean, intuitive layout that aligns with modern web standards while reflecting my personality, skills, and passion for becoming a full stack developer. I chose a Canva-inspired design with bold headers, fixed navigation, and crisp sectioning to make information easy to access and visually appealing. 

The most challenging part was fine-tuning the layout—ensuring perfect alignment, responsive sizing, and smooth flow across devices. I had to troubleshoot Git push errors, refine commit histories, and constantly rework styling to preserve my creative vision without compromising structure. I also found it difficult to translate design ideas into clean CSS that behaved consistently across screen sizes.

What I'm most proud of is how the final product combines style with substance. It’s not just a technical resume it’s a statement of who I am, how I work, and where I’m going. Every section, from the fuel pump project to my Git practices, tells a story of persistence, collaboration, and thoughtful design.
